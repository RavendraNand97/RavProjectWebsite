<h2> About Ravendra Nand</h2>

<p>
 My name is Ravendra Nand, and I am a Data Analyst pursuing a new career opportunity. I graduated from the University of Maryland College Park with a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Science, Data Specialization in December of 2020.  In college, I discovered my passion for diving into data, and discovering important facts, information and even stories within the data. I probably did enjoy it before then, in my sciences courses and science projects but did not recognize that I did. You would conduct some experiment and look at the data that was collect and determine a conclusion. Part of the process is making graphs and charts so that readers can better understand the conclusion. Similarly, in data analyst, I would look at data and try to find patterns or information and show the findings through visualizations so people can better understand the data.
