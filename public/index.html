    <h2> About Ravendra Nand</h2>

    <p>
        My name is Ravendra Nand, and I am a Data Analyst pursuing a new career opportunity. I graduated from the University of Maryland College Park with a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Science, Data Specialization in December of 2020.  In college, I discovered my passion for diving into data, and discovering important facts, information and even stories within the data. I probably did enjoy it before then, in my sciences courses and science projects but did not recognize that I did. You would conduct some experiment and look at the data that was collect and determine a conclusion. Part of the process is making graphs and charts so that readers can better understand the conclusion. Similarly, in data analyst, I would look at data and try to find patterns or information and show the findings through visualizations so people can better understand the data.

        As you explore this website, you will find my resume and projects that I worked on or currently in progress. Throughout my time at UMD I took courses that builds up my experience as a data analyst. I have learned many of the tools that is needed to process and analyze data as well as create visualizations for those data. For example, in the Data Visualization course, I crafted various data presentations using different medias, such as Tableau and Power Point. In Data Manipulation course I explored the ways of sourcing, cleaning, and manipulating data to identify patterns or trends in the data. I also performed statistical analysis on data using R in Statistics for Information Science course. I collaborated with a team to clean, analyze, and create visualization for a client organization data set. Their data had poor data integrity, meaning their data was very inconsistent and inaccurate. The product constitutes a clean data set with good data integrity, and a visualization of their data, which helped them better understand how well they did in their yearly events.

        When I am not doing work in data analysis, there are other areas of interest that I get into as hobbies. I am interested in cars, and I like to look at the new cars that comes out and see how much has changed from the pass. However, I have more interest in older cars than the newer cars because, I believe in the past there was much more focus to styling and power. I am not saying that cars today do not have nice style and power, because there are some that have these qualities, but many of them seems generic. I have spent a good amount of time helping my father work on cars, and they included simple maintenance jobs, all the way to engine rebuild.

        Other things that I have gotten involve in with my father is home improvement. He did home improvement as a job and I normally tag along, and learned many things that is required to improve, or maintain a home. I also like music, and I am keen to music from the Caribbean, a genre called Soca. This is one of the ways I clear my head after a stressful day; other ways include drawing and playing games.

        I will be making updates on this website occasionally, usually to keep my skills in check. I will post projects that I am working on or have done in the past, and it is located under the projects tab. I will be sure to give some descriptions of what the topic is and what is contained in the projects. I may also have a tab that may act as a blog post. Currently I am undecided if this will be available.
